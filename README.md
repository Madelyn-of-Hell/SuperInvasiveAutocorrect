# SuperInvasiveAutocorrect
A small program that monitors your keystrokes and automatically autocorrects any word it perceives to be misspelled. Made with the [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) and [pyspellchecker](https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/) packages.  
Made for Hack Club's [Picoducky](picoducky.hackclub.com) by Madelyn Bell-Leemen.

### Compatibility
Tested on macOS, but Pynput is compatible with all major operating systems so should work everywhere.
